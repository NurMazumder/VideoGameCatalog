Above is the high-level component diagram I made for my group's application, the videogame catalog. Starting from left to right, we first have our deployed website. As we will deploy from vercel, our web client would be directly connected to it, our web-server. Next is our app-server which is built upon react js using the vite build. It is connected to vercel as it is our app that is directly deployed into vercel's server. With our app-server is our mongodb which contains our user data as well as videogame datas. In addition to mongodb is the api we use to fetch data from, rawg api.
